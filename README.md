# dotfiles 
### a collection of my dotfiles and misc. config-related bits and scripts

Storing some of my dotfiles here allows easy portaging of my settings and prefs
across machines, and serves as a handy backup.  

I don't have a fancy bootstrap script here, or a task that will symlink 
everything in this repo to the right spot on your particular machine.  You gots
to do that all manually.  But then again, if you're checking out someone else's
dotfiles, you're more than capable of accomplishing that.  :-)
